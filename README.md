# Covid-19 Data Visualization
<b>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control provides daily data on the coronavirus pandemic 
(COVID-19) through the EU Open Data Portal. The downloadable data files are updated daily and contain the latest available public data on COVID-19.
The data is provided in XML format as you see in the following example:</b>
<ul>
<b> XML: https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/xml/</b>
<li> In this simple application, I pulled the crypto coins with api and showed them with the recyclerview.</li>

<b>Each XML element enclosed by the two tags <record> and </record> contains the date, daily numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths of a particular country, and information about this country.I parse the given XML document to extract all of the records and then keep them in a right Collection implementation.</b>
<b>After extracting the data from the specified XML file, I visualize it by using tables graphs. </b>
